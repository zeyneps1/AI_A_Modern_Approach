    "However, we can get additional efficiency with a couple of tricks. A FIFO queue will be faster than a priority queue, and will give us the correct order of nodes: new nodes go to the back of the queue, and old nodes, get expanded first. That also means we can do an **early goal test**, checking whether a node is a solution as soon as it is generated, rather than the **late goal test** that best-first search uses, waiting until a node is popped off the queue.\n",

    "When actions have different costs, an obvious choice is to use best-first search where the evaluation function is the cost of the path from the root to the current node. The idea is that while breadth-first search spreads out in waves of uniform depth—first depth 1, then depth 2, and so on—uniform-cost search spreads out in waves\n",
    "of uniform path-cost. Uniform-cost search is complete and is cost-optimal, because the first solution it finds will have a cost that is at least as low as the cost of any other node in the frontier. Uniform-cost search considers all paths systematically in order of increasing cost, never getting caught going down a single infinite path.\n",

    "Depth-first search always expands the deepest node in the frontier first. It could be implemented as a call to BEST-FIRST-SEARCH where the evaluation function f is the negative of the depth. However, it is usually implemented not as a graph search but as a tree-like search that does not keep a table of reached states. Depth-first search is not cost-optimal; it returns the first solution it finds, even if it is not cheapest. In cyclic state spaces it can get stuck in an infinite loop; thus, depth-first search is **incomplete**. But tree-like search is feasible, depth-first search has much smaller needs for memory. Memory complexity of only **O(bm)**, where b is the branching factor and m is the maximum depth of the tree. \n",

    "A variant of depth-first search called **backtracking** search uses even less memory. In backtracking, only one successor is generated at a time rather than all successors; each partially expanded node remembers which successor to generate next. In addition, successors are generated by modifying the current state description directly rather than allocating memory for a brand-new state. This reduces the memory requirements to just one state description and a path of **O(m)** actions. With backtracking we also have the option of maintaining an efficient set data structure for the states on the current path, allowing us to check for a cyclic path in **O(1)** time rather than O(m).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4.4 Depth-limited and iterative deepening search\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep depth-first search from wandering down an infinite path, we can use depth-limited search, a version of depth-first search in which we supply a depth limit, ℓ, and treat all nodes at depth ℓas if they had no successors. The time complexity is **O(b^ℓ)** and the space complexity is **O(bℓ)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterative deepening search** solves the problem of picking a good value for ℓby trying all values: first 0, then 1, then 2, and so on—until either a solution is found, or the depth-limited search returns the failure value rather than the cutoff value. Like depth-first search, its memory requirements are modest: **O(bd)** when there is a solution, or **O(bm)** on finite state spaces with no solution. The time complexity is **O(b^d)** when there is a solution, or **O(b^m)** when there is none. Breadth-first does this by storing all nodes in memory, while iterative-deepening does it by repeating the previous levels, thereby saving memory at the cost of more time. "
